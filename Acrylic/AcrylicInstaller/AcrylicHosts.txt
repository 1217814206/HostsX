# IF YOU MAKE ANY CHANGES TO THIS FILE YOU HAVE TO RESTART THE ACRYLIC DNS  #
# PROXY SERVICE IN ORDER TO SEE THEIR EFFECTS.                              #
#                                                                           #
# This is the AcrylicHosts.txt file.                                        #
#                                                                           #
# It contains predefined mappings between names and addresses exactly the   #
# same way the native HOSTS file does.                                      #
#                                                                           #
# Every line corresponds to a single record (mapping).                      #
# The format is: IPADDRESS HOSTNAME                                         #
#                                                                           #
# Where IPADDRESS is in quad-dotted notation and HOSTNAME is a string.      #
# The separator between IPADDRESS and HOSTNAME can be any number of spaces  #
# or tabs or both. The HOSTNAME can also contain the special characters     #
# '*' and '?' in which case a (slow) "dir" like pattern matching algorithm  #
# is used instead of a (fast) binary search within the list of host names:  #
#                                                                           #
# 127.0.0.1 ad.*                                                            #
# 127.0.0.1 ads.*                                                           #
#                                                                           #
# Note: Patterns are evaluated in the same order in which they are written. #
#                                                                           #
# It is also possible to specify exceptions when pattern based matching is  #
# used. If for example we would like to filter out all ads.* like domains   #
# except for the ads.mydomain1 and the ads.mydomain2 we should write:       #
#                                                                           #
# 127.0.0.1 ads.* ads.mydomain1,ads.mydomain2                               #
#                                                                           #
# Multiple exceptions must be on a single line and separated by commas.     #
#                                                                           #
# Note: A line starting with the '#' character is considered a comment and  #
# therefore ignored. If the '#' character is encountered within a line      #
# instead everything before it is parsed while everything after it is       #
# discarded.                                                                #
#                                                                           #
