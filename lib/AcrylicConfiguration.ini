;
AddressCacheScavengingTime=1
;
; The time (in minutes) elapsed which an item in the address cache must be
; silently updated should a request occur. The current request will get the
; old response directly from the address cache but any subsequent request
; will get the updated one.
;

;
; The local IP address to which Acrylic binds. A value of 0.0.0.0 indicates
; that Acrylic should bind to all available addresses and as such it will be
; able to receive DNS requests and responses coming from all of your network
; cards and modems. A value corresponding to the IP address of one of them
; instead will allow Acrylic to receive DNS requests/responses only from
; that specific network card or modem.
;
LocalBindingAddress=0.0.0.0
;
; The UDP port at which Acrylic responds. The default value of 53 is the
; standard port for DNS resolution. You should change this value only if
; you are using a non standard DNS client.
;
LocalBindingPort=53
;
; The file name of the hit log into which every incoming DNS packet seen by
; Acrylic gets logged. You can specify here an absolute or a relative path and
; a sort of daily log rotation can be achieved by including the %DATE% template
; within the name.
;
; In the hit log, along with the packet timestamp and address, there's the
; packet type (how Acrylic treated it) and other info. A packet can be:
;
; B -> Explicitly blocked
; H -> Resolved from the HOSTS cache
; C -> Resolved from the Acrylic cache
; F -> Forwarded to the configured DNS servers
; R -> Received from one of the configured DNS servers
;
; Example:
;
; HitLogFileName=HitLog.%DATE%.txt
;
HitLogFileName=
;
; The filter which controls what gets logged into the hit log previously
; defined. A valid filter is whatever combination of packet types (for their
; meaning see above) specified in any order.

;
; The AllowedAddressesSection section may contain a list of IP addresses
; from which DNS resolution is explicitly allowed. If empty only local DNS
; resolution is allowed. Also part of addresses can be specified, which may
; be useful to include whole subnets with a single line.
;
; Example:
;
; [AllowedAddressesSection]
; IP1=192.168.45.254        -- A single IP address
; IP2=192.168.44.100        -- Another single IP address
; IP3=192.168.100.          -- All addresses starting with 192.168.100.
; IP4=172.16.               -- All addresses starting with 172.16.
;
; For performance reasons keep the number of addresses listed in this section
; as low as possible (try to specify subnets instead of large lists of IP
; addresses for example).
;
[AllowedAddressesSection]
;
; The CacheExceptionsSection section may contain a list of names
; for which caching does not occur (DNS requests for them are directly
; forwarded to the DNS servers). This may be useful if you have a small
; subset of IP addresses that change rapidly but you don't want to loose
; the performance improvements of caching for all the other addresses.
;
; Example:
;
; [CacheExceptionsSection]
; NAME1=somemachine.mydomain.local
; NAME2=www.microsoft.com
;
[CacheExceptionsSection]
;
; The WhiteExceptionsSection section may contain a list of names
; outside of which DNS requests are resolved by Acrylic as "localhost". If
; the section is empty Acrylic behaves normally by trying to resolve every DNS
; request through all its strategies (hosts cache, address cache, forward). If
; the section contains at least an item instead Acrylic behaves as in some
; sort of parental control mode by resolving automatically as "localhost"
; every DNS request for hosts which are not present in the list.
;
; Example:
;
; [WhiteExceptionsSection]
; NAME1=mayakron.altervista.org
; NAME2=en.wikipedia.org
; NAME3=disney.go.com
